%description
The depanneur tool goes through local Git trees and evaluates packaging
meta-data to determine packages needed and the build order; it then starts
the build process and populates a local repository with the generated
binaries; the generated binaries are then used to build the remaining
packages in the queue.

The tool can build one package or multiple packages at a time, making it
possible to build hundreds of packages on a single computer with enough
power in a matter of hours. Depanneur supports two build modes: traditional
build mode and incremental build mode.
