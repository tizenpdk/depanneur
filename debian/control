Description: Manages and executes the builds using the obs-build script.
  The depanneur tool goes through local Git trees and evaluates packaging
  meta-data to determine packages needed and the build order; it then starts
  the build process and populates a local repository with the generated
  binaries; the generated binaries are then used to build the remaining
  packages in the queue.
  This tool can build one package or multiple packages at a time, making it
  possible to build hundreds of packages on a single computer with enough
  power in a matter of hours. Depanneur supports two build modes: traditional
  build mode and incremental build mode.
